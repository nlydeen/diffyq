# About me

Hello!
My name is Nikki Lydeen.

I've been a student in the [climate dynamics](https://science.gmu.edu/academics/departments-units/atmospheric-oceanic-earth-sciences/climate-dynamics-phd/) PhD program at George Mason University since August 2019.
I'm currently investigating statistical learning algorithms for estimating parameters in the [Community Earth System Model](https://cesm.ucar.edu/) (CESM2).
You can find a complete account of my academic history in my [curriculum vitae](/cv/).

I'm an ardent computer programmer and a hobbyist sysadmin.
I like tinkering with [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) (a purely functional package manager) and [Yggdrasil](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/) (a fully encrypted, decentralized IPv6 network).
You can find some of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/nlydeen/).

I enjoy hiking, especially in the conifer forests of the Rocky Mountains.
I'd like to try caving someday, but I haven't had a chance yet.
